1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   User needs are important in the development process.  In order to implement them into a program, planning and planning is needed along with guidance from the Product Owner.  User stories are simplified instructions of a requirement for a software project.  This is important because it assists the developers and other team members in knowing what they need to accomplish for the project.
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
   I approach developing programs by first planning with pseudocode and/or flowcharts to get a good idea of what the program needs to function.  Then, I will develop the code using software development best practices, and if in a team environment it is important to work together and use good communication.  I plan to use Test Driven Development in my future development work as I found it to be the best practice.  This agile practice involves coding, testing, and design being tightly interwoven
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member in software development involves communication, positive feedback on other's work, and fully understanding your role in the development process, whether it be developer, tester, scrum master, etc.
