1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
   There are numerous ways to ensure your code, program, or software is functional and secure.  First, using software development best practices such as writing comments, spacing your code to ensure readability, and following the design requirements.  While I develop code, I try to continuously run the program to ensure it is functional.  I don't wait until I'm fully done writing the code to run and debug it because I want to lessen the bugs and issues.  Additionally, testing your software is particularly important as it makes sure you have a fully functioning program.  Testing can be done through non-functional testing, performance testing, unit testing, etc.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
   User needs is the process of understanding software requirements based on what would benefit the user.  By understand the user's needs such as problems, processes, goals, and preferences, developers can tailor the best software program for their users.  Usually, the product owner and scrum master will put out the software requirements that should meet the user's needs.  Through testing, the user's needs will also be understood more thoroughly.  

3. How do I approach designing software?
   When designing software, first you should fully understand the requirements and point of the software project.  By directly following the software requirements and asking questions, you should be able to approach designing said software with more ease.  Then, I will organize my project and use best practicies to ensure functionality.  Also, one of the most important pieces of developing software is continuously testing and running the project to make sure it works.
